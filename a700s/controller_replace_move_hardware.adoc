To replace the controller module hardware, you must remove the impaired controller, move FRU components to the replacement controller module, install the replacement controller module in the chassis, and then boot the system to Maintenance mode.

== Step 1: Remove the controller module

You must remove the controller module from the chassis when you replace the controller module or replace a component inside the controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properlcontrolleround yourself.
. Loosen the hook and loop strap binding the cables to the cable management device, and then unplug the system cables and SFPs (if needed) from the controller module, keeping track of where the cables were connected.
+
Leave the cables in the cable management device so that when you reinstall the cable management device, the cables are organized.

. Unplug the controller module power supply from the source, and then unplug the cable from the power supply.
. Remove the cable management device from the controller module and set it aside.
. Press down on both of the locking latches, and then rotate both latches downward at the same time.
+
The controller module moves slightly out of the chassis.

== Step 2: Move the NVRAM card

As part of the controller replacement process, you must remove the NVRAM card from Riser 1 in the impaired controller module and install the card into Riser 1 of the replacement controller module. You should only reinstall Riser 1 into the replacement controller module after you have moved the DIMMs from the impaired controller module to the replacement controller module.

. Remove the NVRAM riser, Riser 1, from the controller module:
 .. Rotate the riser locking latch on the left side of the riser up and toward the fans.
+
The NVRAM riser raises up slightly from the controller module.

 .. Lift the NVRAM riser up, shift it toward the fans so that the sheet metal lip on the riser clears the edge of the controller module, lift the riser straight up out of the controller module, and then place it on a stable, flat surface so that you can access the NVRAM card.

. Note the orientation of the DIMM in the socket so that you can insert the DIMM in the replacement controller module in the proper orientation.
. Eject the DIMM from its slot by slowly pushing apart the two DIMM ejector tabs on either side of the DIMM, and then slide the DIMM out of the slot.
+
NOTE: Carefully hold the DIMM by the edges to avoid pressure on the components on the DIMM circuit board.

. Locate the slot where you are installing the DIMM.
. Make sure that the DIMM ejector tabs on the connector are in the open position, and then insert the DIMM squarely into the slot.
+
The DIMM fits tightly in the slot, but should go in easily. If not, realign the DIMM with the slot and reinsert it.
+
NOTE: Visually inspect the DIMM to verify that it is evenly aligned and fully inserted into the slot.

. Push carefully, but firmly, on the top edge of the DIMM until the ejector tabs snap into place over the notches at the ends of the DIMM.
. Repeat these steps for the remaining DIMMs.

== Step 7: Install the NVRAM module

To install the NVRAM module, you must follow the specific sequence of steps.

. Install the riser into the controller module:
 .. Align the lip of the riser with the underside of the controller module sheet metal.
 .. Guide the riser along the pins in the controller module, and then lower the riser into the controller module.
 .. Swing the locking latch down and click it into the locked position.
+
When locked, the locking latch is flush with the top of the riser and the riser sits squarely in the controller module.

 .. Reinsert any SFP modules that were removed from the PCIe cards.

== Step 8: Move the NVRAM battery

When replacing the controller module, you must move the NVRAM battery from the impaired controller module to the replacement controller module

. Locate the NVRAM battery on the left side of the riser module, Riser 1.

 .. Slide the battery pack down along the sheet metal side wall until the support tabs on the side wall hook into the slots on the battery pack, and the battery pack latch engages and locks into place.
 .. Press firmly down on the battery pack to make sure that it is locked into place.
 .. Plug the battery plug into the riser socket and make sure that the plug locks into place.

== Step 9: Install a PCIe riser

To install a PCIe riser, you must follow a specific sequence of steps.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Install the riser into the controller module:
 .. Align the lip of the riser with the underside of the controller module sheet metal.
 .. Guide the riser along the pins in the controller module, and then lower the riser into the controller module.
 .. Swing the locking latch down and click it into the locked position.
+
When locked, the locking latch is flush with the top of the riser and the riser sits squarely in the controller module.

 .. Reinsert any SFP modules that were removed from the PCIe cards.
. Repeat the preceding steps for Riser 3 and PCIe cards in slots 4 and 5 in the impaired controller module.

== Step 10: Move the power supply

You must move the power supply and power supply blank from the impaired controller module to the replacement controller module when you replace a controller module.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. Rotate the cam handle such that it can be used to pull power supply out of the controller module while pressing the locking tab.
+
CAUTION: The power supply is short. Always use two hands to support it when removing it from the controller module so that it does not suddenly swing free from the controller module and injure you.

The power supplies will only properly engage with the internal connector and lock in place one way.
+
NOTE: To avoid damaging the internal connector, do not use excessive force when sliding the power supply into the system.

. Remove the PSU blanking panel from the impaired controller module, and then install it in the replacement controller module.

== Step 11: Install the controller module

After all the components have been moved from the impaired controller module to the replacement controller module, you must install the replacement controller module into the chassis and then boot it to Maintenance mode.

. If you are not already grounded, properly ground yourself.
. If you have not already done so, close the air duct:
 .. Swing the air duct all the way down to the controller module.
 .. Slide the air duct toward the risers until the locking tabs click into place.
 .. Inspect the air duct to make sure that it is properly seated and locked into place.

. Align the end of the controller module with the opening in the chassis, and then gently push the controller module halfway into the system.
+
NOTE: Do not completely insert the controller module in the chassis until instructed to do so.

. Cable the management and console ports only, so that you can access the system to perform the tasks in the following sections.
+
NOTE: You will connect the rest of the cables to the controller module later in this procedure.

. Complete the reinstallation of the controller module:
 .. Firmly push the controller module into the chassis until it meets the midplane and is fully seated.
+
The locking latches rise when the controller module is fully seated.
+
NOTE: Do not use excessive force when sliding the controller module into the chassis to avoid damaging the connectors.
+
The controller module begins to boot as soon as it is fully seated in the chassis. Be prepared to interrupt the boot process.

.. Rotate the locking latches upward, tilting them so that they clear the locking pins, and then lower them into the locked position.
.. Interrupt the boot process by pressing `Ctrl-C`.
. Plug the system cables and transceiver modules into the controller module and reinstall the cable management device.
. Plug the power cables into the power supplies and reinstall the power cable retainers.

. If your system is configured to support 10 GbE cluster interconnect and data connections on 40 GbE NICs or onboard ports, convert these ports to 10 GbE connections by using the nicadmin convert command from Maintenance mode.
+
NOTE: Be sure to exit Maintenance mode after completing the conversion.
